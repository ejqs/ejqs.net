Hello, I'm EJ. I just recently graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science, and now I'm trying to figure out life.

I created this website as an outlet of what I'm thinking about and what I've learned, so as to share it to you, the endless empty void of the internet.

I'm not so sure if anyone will be reading this, but at the very least, probably my future self (or idk).

<p class="small">if you are reading this, send me an email ejqs [at] ejqs [d0t]net, say Hello!</p>

In my website, I will try to post things that I've learned over time. These "things" may be related to software things, ai?, or probably just reflections I've had over the previous months.

I will try to post something every few months.
