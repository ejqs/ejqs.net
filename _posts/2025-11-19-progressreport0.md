I got inspired to do a progress report by this X account [lelouch.dev](https://lelouch.dev/). So, consider this post a start for something new.

## Commitment

I will post two things every Wednesday, 9 PM (GMT+8) +/- 10 mins:

1. What I have learned
2. What I will learn

This ranges anywhere from what I've learned in Mathematics, ML, and Software Development/Architecture to hobbies such as language learning (Japanese atm) and music.

_alternating between the two to prevent myself from burning out_

## Goal

At the end of the day, I want to be able to create something. Whether it just be stories written in this blog or something tangible that people can use, I want to try to create more than what I consume.

## Plan

November 19 - November 26

- 1 hour a day on [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/)
- burn through my 370+ backlog on [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/)
