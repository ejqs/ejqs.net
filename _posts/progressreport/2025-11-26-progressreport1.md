It's 9 PM and I have updates.

7 days ago, I decided to post a weekly update to what I have studied.

Do I expect anyone to care? I hope that I won't 🥸

But I do feel that I need accountability to make this habit stick. So whether, it'll just be me reading back on this or not, I do not want to look back a year from now to be in the exact place I started.

As a new grad, it feels that I have a responsibility to hone my skills while I have no responsibilities... so here is my update for the past week, what I learned, and my plan for the next.

# Update

- ✅ (not even planned tho) Side Projects / Side Hustles
- ❌ 1/7 hours studied
- ❌ 0 WaniKani slides

What a great start to this progress log. What went wrong? I was too ambitious and didn't plan ahead... I think.

# Lessons

404

# 🌟 (New) Plan

November 27 - December 3

- 20 mins a day on Designing Data-Intensive Applications
- Burn through my WaniKani backlogs... at least bring it down from 370 to 170 (take 2)
